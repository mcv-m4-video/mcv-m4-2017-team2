This code is provided to help you process the videos of the
changedetection.net dataset and gather statistics

1)	Download the dataset and unzip all the files in the same folder. ex :
"c:\dataset"
	You should get this :
		c:\dataset\baseline\highway\input\
		c:\dataset\baseline\highway\groundtruth\
		c:\dataset\baseline\...
		c:\dataset\...
		c:\dataset\thermal\...

	*** Please do not change or put anything else in the "dataset" folder ***


	On the same level as dataset\, there is a 'results' folder filled with the
proper folder hierarchy.  These folders are all empty and will contain your
results.

2)	Download the MATLAB code and unzip it somewhere. ex : "c:\datasetcode\"

3)	Start MATLAB, go to the folder containing the MATLAB code (ex.
"c:\datasetcode\")
	Search for "TODO" and add your code there.

4)	When you are ready, call processFolder(datasetPath, binaryRootPath)

	ex : processFolder('C:\dataset', 'C:\results')

5)	Once you are ready, zip the 'results' folder and fill out the form on the
changedetection.net Upload page.

	*** Please, use only zip for compression, we support no other compression
format. tar, gz, 7z, etc. are not supported  ****

	*** This code calculates 7 metrics, namely (1)Recall, (2)Specificity, (3)FPR, (4)FNR, (5)PBC, (6)Precision, (7)FMeasure. The metric "FPR-S" is only calcualated for "Shadow" category on the server side, but not in this code. If it's really necessary, 

FPR_S = float(nbShadowError) / nbShadow

where nbShadowError is the number in the last column in the 'cm' file you get, that is the number of times a pixel is labeled as shadow in GT but detected as moving object. nbShadow is the total number of pixel labeled as shadow in GT for a video or category.****
